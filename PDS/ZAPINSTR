             ZAPPING A VTOC ENTRY WITH UCLA FULL SCREEN ZAP
             ----------------------------------------------

 PLEASE SEE THE BOTTOM OF THIS MEMBER FIRST.

 I AM REFERRING TO THE ZAP PROGRAM AVAILABLE ON FILE 300 OF THE CBT
    MVS MODS TAPE.  THIS IS JIM MARSHALL'S LIBRARY OF TSO COMMANDS.
    (THE ZAP COMMAND IS INCLUDED IN THE LOADLIB IN THIS PDS.)

 I ASSUME YOU HAVE THE ZAP PROGRAM PROPERLY INSTALLED.  IT IS A TSO
    COMMAND, AND IT MUST BE EXECUTED AUTHORIZED IN ORDER TO ZAP A VTOC
    ENTRY.  IF YOU CAN'T DO THIS, PLEASE CONSULT YOUR LOCAL TSO GURU
    UNTIL YOU'VE GOTTEN IT RIGHT.  (FOR MOST USES, ZAP DOESN'T HAVE
    TO BE AUTHORIZED, BUT FOR THIS USE, IT DOES.)

 TO GET TO THE VTOC ON A GIVEN PACK DO THE FOLLOWING: (I AM ASSUMING
    THAT THE PACK NAME IS PACK01.

       :  THE ZAP PROGRAM CAN NOW BE EXECUTED DIRECTLY AGAINST A
          PARTICULAR DASD VOLSER, AS FOLLOWS:

          ZAP 'FORMAT4.DSCB' VOL(PACK01)

          THIS POINTS YOU TO THE VTOC OF THE PACK "PACK01".

      A.  INVOKE THE ZAP PROGRAM AUTHORIZED:
                   ( ENTER THE COMMAND:  ZAP  IF ZAP IS ALREADY
                      AUTHORIZED ON YOUR SYSTEM.  OR.... )
                   ( YOU CAN ALSO USE AN "AUTHORIZER" COMMAND,
                      SUCH AS THE AUCMD MODULE INCLUDED HERE )

  HINT:   ON FILE 300 (AND INCLUDED HERE), THERE IS A "COMMAND
          AUTHORIZER" PROGRAM CALLED AUCMD.  IF YOU INSTALL THAT
          COMMAND IN AN APF-AUTHORIZED LOAD LIBRARY,
          AUTHORIZE IT IN THE IKJEFTE2 TABLE (IKJTSOXX
          MEMBER OF PARMLIB, "AUTHCMD" NAMES LIST), AND
          EXECUTE THE PARMLIB UPDATE(XX) COMMAND,
          THEN YOU CAN USE IT TO AUTHORIZE OTHER TSO COMMANDS, BY
          SAYING:  AUCMD TSOCMD PARAMETERS .  THIS WILL RUN "TSOCMD"
          AS AN APF-AUTHORIZED TSO COMMAND, USING ITS OWN PARAMETERS.

           *  NOTE.  IF YOU'RE ZAPPING ANY DATASET, JUST ENTER
                       ITS TSO-QUALIFIED NAME.  THE ZAP COMMAND
                       WILL INITIALLY POINT YOU TO THE VERY
                       BEGINNING OF THE DATASET.  IF IT IS A PDS,
                       YOU'LL GET THE BEGINNING OF THE DIRECTORY,
                       AND AN "M" COMMAND WILL POINT YOU TO THE
                       BEGINNING OF THAT MEMBER NAME.  IF IT IS
                       A LOAD MODULE, THE "E" COMMAND WILL POINT
                       YOU TO THE ENTRY POINT YOU DESIGNATE.

                     EXAMPLE:   ZAP 'SYS1.LPALIB'
                                MIEFBR14
                                EIEFBR14

      C.  THE SYSTEM WILL NOW DISPLAY THE FORMAT4 (HEADER) DSCB.
              THE ZAP PROGRAM HAS A BUILT-IN TUTORIAL THAT CAN
              BE ENTERED BY PUTTING "?" ON THE COMMAND LINE.
              TO GET OUT OF THE TUTORIAL, PUT "U" ON THE COMMAND
              LINE AND PRESS ENTER.

              CHANGES ARE MADE PERMANENT WITH THE COMMAND
              "ZAP".

      D.  ADVICE:  LEARN THE ZAP TUTORIAL FIRST.  YOU CAN ALWAYS GET
              INTO IT BY ENTERING "?" ON THE CMD LINE, AND BACK TO
              WHERE YOU WERE BY ENTERING "U" ON THE COMMAND LINE.
              THE TUTORIAL HAS 13 SCREENS.  AT LEAST GLANCE AT THEM ALL.
              YOU DON'T PUT SPACES BETWEEN THE COMMAND AND THE OPERAND.
              THE COMMAND "END" QUITS YOU OUT OF ZAP AT ANY TIME.
              THE COMMAND "P" GETS YOU TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FORMAT4.
              THERE IS A LITTLE ARROW "<" OR ">" THAT POINTS TO
              THE CURRENT BYTE.  GO FORWARD AND BACKWARD BY ENTERING
              PLUS OR MINUS THE NUMBER OF BYTES IN HEX.  FOR EXAMPLE:
              +3 (3 BYTES FORWARD), -C (X'C' BYTES BACKWARD), ETC.
              TO SUBSTITUTE UP TO 8 BYTES STARTING FROM THE CURRENT
              BYTE, ENTER "S" FOLLOWED BY A HEX VALUE--NO SPACES IN
              BETWEEN.  TO MAKE CHANGES PERMANENT, ENTER "ZAP".
              ALWAYS GET A ZAP LOG IF YOU'VE CHANGED SOMETHING, UNTIL
              YOU'RE COMPLETELY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM.

  ******      IT IS ADVISABLE TO ZAP SOME LESS-MEANINGFUL DATASETS
  ******      BEFORE TACKLING A VTOC.
