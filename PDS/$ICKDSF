The following example of expanding a VTOC and a VTOC index for
a disk pack, was paraphrased from the IBM manual:

Device Support Facilities - User's Guide and Reference

The following is an example of expanding the VTOC and the Index
using the EXTVTOC and EXTINDEX parameters.

 //EXAMPLE   JOB
 //          EXEC  PGM=ICKDSF
 //VOLDD     DD DISP=SHR,UNIT=3390,VOL=SER=DATA01
 //SYSPRINT  DD    SYSOUT=A
 //SYSIN     DD    *
  REFORMAT DDNAME(VOLDD) VERIFY(DATA01) EXTVTOC(200) EXTINDEX(16)
 /*

An example of the ICKDSF output from the above job is as follows:

 ICK00700I DEVICE INFORMATION FOR 0A93 IS CURRENTLY AS FOLLOWS:
           PHYSICAL DEVICE = 3390
           STORAGE CONTROLLER = 3990
           STORAGE CONTROL DESCRIPTOR = EC
           DEVICE DESCRIPTOR = 1E
 ICK04000I DEVICE IS IN SIMPLEX STATE
 ICK01520I THE VTOC-INDEX WAS DELETED
 ICK01314I VTOC IS LOCATED AT CCHH=X'0000 0001' AND IS   200 TRACKS.
 ICK01502I BUILDIX FUNCTION STARTED
 ICK01503I 0A93 REQUEST RECEIVED TO CONVERT VTOC TO IXFORMAT
 ICK01504I 0A93 VTOC FORMAT IS CURRENTLY OSFORMAT, REQUEST ACCEPTED
 ICK01508A 0A93 SHOULD CONVERSION PROCEED? REPLY U TO CONTINUE, ELSE T
 ICK01513I 0A93  BUILDIX PROCESSING COMPLETED: VTOC IS NOW IN IXFORMAT
 ICK00001I FUNCTION COMPLETED, HIGHEST CONDITION CODE WAS 0
